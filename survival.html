<p style="top: 50px; position: relative; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;"><i>Fortnite provides a Sandbox gamemode known as Survival. You build your base and protect yourself from the endless onslaught of zombies. Craft Weapons, Tools, and Traps to stop the apocolyspe. This mode provides many characters to choose from and collect. Each and every weapon and character changes the play style of the whole game so find whats right for you and save the world!!! In Fortnite’s fiction, the majority of the world’s population has been killed off in a series of apocalyptic storms. Humans have been turned into man-eating zombies called husks who wear their victims like a hoodie, with the tops of their heads dangling around their shoulders. By some feat of design these monsters, which you will slaughter by the thousands, are actually kind of adorable. It’s as if Pixar sat in to do a season of The Walking Dead.

That backstory puts players in the role of the Commander, a faceless avatar with a whole lot of resources at their disposal. You’ll split your time between back-end resource management and third-person combat. In motion, Fortnite is primarily a base defense game where you take control of one of many collectible heroes and push back against a horde of onrushing husks. I spent much of the early game crafting a persistent “homebase” out of the materials and traps I collected in each mission while also leveling up my favorite heroes. </i></p>
